/*
Create a game that simulates taking a multiple choice scantron test.

The user will press the A, B, C, D, or E key, and the app
will pick one of those letters at random to be the "correct" answer.

Then, the app should update the #previous-letter element with the
correct letter, the #last-guess element with the letter the
user pressed, increase the #correct element number, increase the
#incorrect element number, and show a score that is a whole number
percentage of the wins/total guesses so far in the #score element.

Clicking the reset button should set #correct and #incorrect to 0, as
well as setting the #score, #previous-letter, and #last-guess elements
as blank.
